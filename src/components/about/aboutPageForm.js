					Dear <Typography variant="inherit" color="secondary">visitor</Typography>, this webapplication is just a small
					(but very proud <EmojiInline emoji={'üòé'}/>) <Typography variant="inherit" color="secondary">home
					project</Typography> to
					keep my IT knowledge <EmojiInline emoji={'üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª‚Äç'}/>up to date.
					So don't be surprised <EmojiInline emoji={'üôÄ'}/>by various features which maybe not needed.
					For example, the authorization<EmojiInline emoji={'üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è'}/>Ô∏è - c'mon we both know that it's too much
					for so small app, right? But who cares,<Typography variant="inherit" color="secondary"> I can do here
					whatever I want</Typography>, right? <EmojiInline emoji={'üòà'}/>
				</Typography>
				<Typography variant="body1" color="textPrimary" align="justify" paragraph>
					<span style={{marginLeft: 15}}/>
					Alright, after that small (but again - proud) disclaimer, you'd like to know - what is that all about, huh? So
					here're the
					main points:
				</Typography>
				<NumberedList number={1}
											text="Aliyah will help you to compare salary/expenses of your current location (country/city) with locations you'd like to relocate to."/>
				<NumberedList number={2}
											text="Firstly, you need to login/signup. Then you'll chose your current location. After that you'll provide a list of countries to compare."/>
				<NumberedList number={3}
											text="Use the bottom buttons to navigate through the site. Play around and text me if you have an excellent idea about improvements."/>
				<NumberedList number={4}
											text={"Remember - everything was developed by only myself, so it's bug-free (obviously). If you find something, it's meant to be there"}/>
